        <p>The Quebec Agreement between the United Kingdom and the United States
          outlined terms for coordinated scientific development of nuclear energy.
           It stipulated that the US and UK would pool their resources to develop
           nuclear weapons, and that neither would use the weapons against another
           country without mutual consent, or pass information about them to other
           countries.
